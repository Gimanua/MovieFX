## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to build the project.

### Prerequisites
* [Java JDK 13](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html)
* [Set JAVA_HOME system variable to Java JDK 13](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)

* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

**If you have multiple Java installations it's important that Java JDK 13 is the first entry in both the JAVA_HOME and PATH system variables.**

All of the links have been checked to work **at the time of writing** and are not guaranteed to be working depending on when this README is read.

### Installing
* Open XAMPP.
   If you don't find XAMPP by searching for it do this:
   1. Open the file explorer.
   2. Go to XAMPP installation folder (usually C:\xampp).
   3. Open xampp-control.
* Start both MySQL and Apache.
* Click the admin button on MySQL to get to phpMyAdmin.
* Import the database.
* Open NetBeans.
* Open the project.
* Right-click on Dependencies and click on Download declared dependencies.

With all of the setup out of the way, you should now be able to build the project.
